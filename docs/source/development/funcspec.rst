Apollo
======

Quasar microlensing software suite.


Overview
--------
Apollo is a software suite for
Downloading magnification maps from the internet
Magnification maps take several days to process and download off the GERLPUMPH server. A download request is then emailed to the user. This could be automated but probably not worth the time
1.	Pre-processing magnification maps
2.	Simulating (simple) quasar accretion disks
3.	Formatting quasar simulations for image convolution
4.	Convolving image
a.	Including functionality for animations of this process
5.	Fitting light-curves with theoretical microlensing caustic curve equations
6.	Triggering mechanism(s) for targets of opportunity which exceed a given threshold
